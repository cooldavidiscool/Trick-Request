--------------------------
install script in Streamlabs Chatbot (aka SLCB)  
enable the script  
click on script  
input your settings  

	dfault message for landing tricks is * * T R I C K  L A N D E D * *
	
	you don't HAVE to use the source display for after landing a trick, the script will send
	messages saying tricks added and landed by default

	HOWEVER, if you do want to display a source on OBS, make sure you have
		source name
		scene name (where the source is gonna be at)
		duration (how long the source will be displayed)
	then fill the settings out with that info
	MAKE SURE YOU DO EACH SETTING OR IT MAY NOT WORK

click save settings  
reload your scripts (its the top right of SLCB)   *i'm currently trying to fix this so you don't have to reload*  
try out the script!  
	
	!tr (or !trick) then the trick
	
	ex. !tr do a kickflip


if you have any questions, feel free to ask me!  
I'll make a video on how to set it up soon
